The popular Snake video game with some additions.
In this game the player controls a snake and the objective is to eat as many apples as possible. 
Each time the snake eats an apple, its body grows. The snake must avoid touching the walls, the brick boxes and its own body.
An option for temporary passage through brick boxes appears as a star. When the snake eats the star it enables the snake to go through the brick boxes for a period of time.
